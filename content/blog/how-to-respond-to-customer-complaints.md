Not everyone knows that in 2019 I started a dance school in my hometown. Such a school (especially when it is for adults) is a place where people can not only learn to dance, but also practice during events hosted by us. You can imagine the logistic effort needed to organize a massive dance party, especially when it comes to the craziest night of the year, New Year's Eve! Unfortunately, our endeavors were not to everyone's liking. Our profile on social media (apart from the avalanche of raptures) showed a particularly negative comment. Now, the question arises, what should we write back, according to science? 

Research that attempts to answer this question was presented by Shereen J. Chaudhry and Akshin Banerjee at
 __the 2022 annual meeting of the Society for Judgment and Decision Making__
 during the presentation entitled "The Language of Apologies in Responses to Customer Reviews". 

<div class="boxWarning">Note that the study discussed in this article has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal. For this reason, the conclusions presented here should be taken with a grain of salt. If you have seen this article published, please let the author know!  </div>

### Research Question 

Over the past 40 years, dozens of scientists have proposed many components that they believe make up an apology. The authors of this study put them together and attempted to establish (1) which of these components are necessary to call the answer an "apology", (2) when an apology is perceived as sincere, and (3) what makes a customer's complaint response satisfactory. Furthermore, the study aimed to find a data-based definition of apology. 

  
### Method 

 
The data consisted of around 900 hotel manager responses for customer ratings of 3 stars (of 5) from the TripAdvisor website. 

Each review-response pair was evaluated by MTurk /prolific workers for many characteristics such as response satisfaction, likelihood of visiting this hotel in the future, the existence of victim blaming (in a manager response), etc. Ratings were given on a scale of -30 to 30. 
 

<div class="boxCheck">Note that the assessments of managers' responses are made by external observers, not by the people who submitted the complaint. This is an interesting prospect because these responses are publicly available and (maybe) taken into account as a determinant of the quality of consumer service quality. However, we do not have arguments to assume that they would be assessed in the same way by dissatisfied customers. </div>

### Statistical Mechanism 

Experimental results are presented in such plots:

We will leave the technicalities of this chart for another occasion and today we will focus on the interpretation of the results. The graph shows how the presence of the elements listed in the rows (IFID, offer of repair, promise to change) in the hotel manager's response affects the assessment whether it was an apology or not. The strength of this influence obtained in the study is marked red in the diagram. Researchers, wanting to be precise, gave not only the estimated value (red dot), but also the range in which we can be "almost certain" that the true value lands (the red line crossing the dot). 

Consider the first column, IFID (btw. IFID is just a fancy way of describing the presence of "I am sorry" in the manager's response). The red range extends roughly between 5.5 and 6.5. This means that the phrase ‘I'm sorry’ in a manager's response, increases (by  +/- 6 points on a scale of -30 to 30 ) the assessment of a question 'Does the hotel manager's response contain an apology?' by customers. It makes sense. 

Now, let us look at the second "offer to repair" column. We can see that the red range intersects the black dashed vertical line that represents the zero. This means that perhaps the proposal to repair the damage does not affect the reception of the response. ‘Perhaps’ because the absence of evidence of impact does not mean that there is no impact. However, we can say that under this experiment, we have no reason to believe that offering a willingness to repair will cause customers to consider our response a better apology. This is an interesting conclusion, given that such compensation is rarely free for the hotel. 

### Results

 So, if you really want to apologize, say sorry, acknowledge the harm that was done (show empathy), express regret, and keep it short (slight negative impact of response length "word count".)

What do you need to add to make your apologies sincere? Make it personal. And if you really care (and do not mind additional costs), you can do slightly better by offering a repair, asking for forgiveness, and using a few more words than your customer. However, it is worth noting that this would not make a world of difference. 

 

<div class="boxComment">Upon very careful examination of the graph, you will discover that some more "red lines" do not touch zero. However, the values of these effects are so small that I decided to omit them. </div>
</br>

Now, it becomes interesting. Does our response have to include an apology at all to be considered satisfactory? It turns out that not necessarily.

 It seems that prevention is better than cure. Make sure that you can only be accused of trivialities. However, if you do have a mishap, start by... putting all the generic apology templates in the trash. Take a moment to think about the client's complaint and make your response personal. The data suggest that this is the most important factor in perceiving your answer as satisfactory. 

 

## A Fallow-Up Study  

The authors seemed surprised by the lack of influence of "responsibility taking" in the results of their experiment. This is in contradiction to many contemporary theories, including their own. For this reason, they designed an additional experiment to look at this a little more closely. 

 

### Method 

This time there was only one complaint, and all responses were crafted by experimenters. They were constructed in such a way that they differ from each other by one single detail (the presence or absence of a sorry statement, the taking of responsibility, and the promise to change). Each option was made in four versions. Therefore, we had 2 (presence/absence of ‘I’m sorry’) * 2 (presence/absence of responsibility taking) * 2 (presence/absence of promise to change) * 4 versions = 32 prefabricated responses. 877 MTurk workers received a version of the story and the question: ‘Regardless of what you think it is effective, do you think the response at least contains an apology in it?’ Participants were encouraged to respond in a range from –30 (definitely not) to 30 (definitely yes). 

### Results

{{< image src="images/post/apologies/box_ifid.png">}}

This chart looks different but is quite like the previous one. First, the rows have been changed to columns. Second, the value at which the gray bar ends plays the role of the red dot. On the other hand, the role of the “almost certain range" marked earlier as a red line is played by delicate black braces signed "error bars". 

How can we interpret this graph?  When the answer does not contain any of the listed elements, people think that our answer is definitely not an apology. Taking responsibility and promising to improve bits of help. However, it turns out that our mothers were right (as usual), and "I am sorry" is really a magical word. 

<div class="boxPlus">It is also worth explaining the meaning of these long horizontal braces between the bars. These ‘three asterisks’ and the very small numbers compared to p only tell us that we are (very) sure that the differences between the values of the bars are significant. </div> </br>

Now, we may ask how these data compare with the first experiment. We recall that previously "I am sorry" added only 6 points on the scale, and here it is almost 25! There are many reasons for these differences, and this is material for a separate article or a series of them. However, we can conclude that the key to responding to a customer's complaint is simply saying, "I am sorry." 

### Conclusions 

Dear Szymon, 

We apologize to you. We are sorry that you did not like our New Year's Eve party. It is a shame that you had difficulty finding a seat, especially since everyone deserves some relaxation during an all-night party. As a compensation, we would like to offer you a 10% discount on any event in the coming year. 

All the best! 

Also for you, dear reader :)
